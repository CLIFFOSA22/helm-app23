step 1

Install Helm 3:

curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
 ./get_helm.sh

step 2
Add helm repo to your helm environment to be able to install other application using helm chart repo. 

This helm repo by default is below

https://charts.helm.sh/stable

To add the repo to your helm environment, you run

helm add repo aliasName https://charts.helm.sh/stable

Let us called the aliasname webserver. You run

helm add repo webserver https://charts.helm.sh/stable

update the repo by running

helm repo update

INSTALLATION OF OTHER APPLICATION USING HELM

To install Nginx Ingress

To install ingress, you need to find the helm chartname for nginx by running

helm search repo webserver 

helm search repo webserver | grep nginx

If it is webserver/nginx-ingress  that came out as the chartName, you can now install nginx 
by running

helm install deploymentName chartName

let us call the deployName to be  nginx

helm install nginx webserver/nginx-ingress

What ever you get as a chartName, you can run the below command to install nginx by running

ANOTHER WAY
You can also deploy nginx ingress by adding nginx helmm repo directly in your helm enrionment 
as below

https://helm.nginx.com/stable

helm repo add nginx https://helm.nginx.com/stable

helm repo add nginx https://helm.nginx.com/stable

helm repo update
